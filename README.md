# Amjad India - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
I’m a passionate and detail-oriented aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in tools like SQL, Excel, Tableau, and basic Python. I specialize in data cleaning, visualization, and reporting, and I’m actively building a portfolio to showcase my ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

I’ve completed projects that demonstrate skills in dashboard creation, messy data cleaning, typing speed apps, and web scraping, and I’m always exploring ways to combine creativity with logic. I’m currently learning Alteryx and improving my skills in Linux and ethical hacking, aiming to become a well-rounded tech professional.

I believe in consistent growth, learning by doing, and staying calm and focused even when challenges arise. My goal is to start as a Data Analyst, grow in the private sector, and eventually take my skills abroad.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
